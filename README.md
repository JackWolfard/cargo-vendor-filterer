# `cargo vendor`, but with filtering

The core `cargo vendor` tool is useful to save all dependencies.
However, it doesn't offer any filtering; today cargo includes
all platforms, but some projects only care about Linux
for example.

```
$ cargo vendor-filterer --linux-only --tar=myproject-vendor.tar
```
